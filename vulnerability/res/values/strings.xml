    <string name="aboutModelText">"This adapted model for calculation of structural vulnerability to flooding is based on CIMDEN 2001 model from the following literature: Villagrán de León, J.C. (2006), Vulnerability, A Conceptual and Methodological Review, Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS).

[1] In this model, physical or structural vulnerability is expressed according the present condition of the house and addresses those elements which can lead to damages or destruction in case of an event (in this case flood).

[2] The method has been adapted to handle different hazards. Adaptation to different hazards is made recognizing the impact of the hazard on the various components of the house.

[3] Each indicator has weight classifications depending on the construction material with numbers 1, 3 and 5. There is an explanation of construction material for each number.

[4] The indicators do not show how vulnerability depends on the magnitude of the hazard. The method is based on the consideration of a very high magnitude event, but cannot cope with small-magnitude events.

[5] The overall vulnerability is classified in three ranges (degree of structural vulnerability) low 37-80 points, medium 81-130 points and high 131-185 points.

[6] The vulnerability assessment can be employed to assess the vulnerability of a single house, but can be aggregated at the community, municipal, province, and national level.

[7] Construction materials and construction techniques depends on the given region of interest.

[8] The method requires a specific survey at the household level to gather information."
